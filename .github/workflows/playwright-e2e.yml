name: Playwright E2E

# Notes:
# - To allow live E2E runs, add a repository secret named `RUN_LIVE_E2E` and set it to `true` only
#   when you want to enable live, production-adjacent tests. Keep this secret off for normal PRs.
# - Protect the `live-e2e` environment (Repository Settings → Environments) and require
#   reviews/approvals before allowing jobs to run there — this provides an additional safety
#   gate beyond the secret.
# - The `live-e2e` job checks `secrets.RUN_LIVE_E2E` at runtime and will abort if it is not set
#   to `true`. Use manual `workflow_dispatch` to start the live job and ensure approvers are
#   available to review the protected environment.
